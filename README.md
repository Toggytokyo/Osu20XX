# Osu20XX
Osu20XX is a small program that uses machine learning to tell you what year's mapping style a map most closely resembles. Simply drag and drop a .osz or .osu file into the window and select the difficulty to see the results.

The ML algorithm predicts the mapping style correctly 60% of the time and is usually only off by about 1-2 years when it is wrong.

I plan on adding more functionality to this into the future, including:
* General mapping style detection (pp, tech, etc)
* Map recommendations
* Customizable ML Model
* More
